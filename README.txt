In this project about the power of open-source, all files within the 
/assets/lib/ directory should be assumed as resources from external sources.


All scripts used on this site are licensed under an Open Source license, and
therefore they are being used within legal bounds.

This project was created using Cloud9, an open-source, cloud-based IDE for web
development.

The purpose of this site is to show the power and harmony that can be achieved
when a web developer combines open-source projects, and therefore many 
open-source projects have been included.

Assume that any files outside of the /assets/lib/ directory have been made by 
Garrett Mills, Jake Mitchell or both, with the exception of images.
